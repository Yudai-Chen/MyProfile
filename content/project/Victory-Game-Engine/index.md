Victory Game Engine is a 3-D First Person Shooting game engine.

It is based on modern OpenGL, developed by C++ 11.

First person traveling, keyboard & mouse controlling, geometry modeling, 3-D collision detection, global shader, model import, heads-up display, gravity simulation and responsive sounds are all implemented.

Here is a demo, a remake of the famous game Counter-Strike (together with Steve!).
