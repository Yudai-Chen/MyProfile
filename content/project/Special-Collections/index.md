Special Collections is a data display web application. It can either work with Omeka-S back-end or as a standalone.

It provides a researcher with a personal, flexible digital archive, enabling them to import, edit, inter-link, and custom mark-up their digital media. They can act as their own librarian, accelerating their research, without artificially limiting the scale or complexity of their collection.

It can handle hierarchical (folder-tree-like) data but guides users towards elaborating more complex relations within their collections. In other words, it can bring us from a beginner's work to a professor's work, as a complexly internally-related digital archive.

Here is an introduction video of this project. The speaker is my internship mentor, Dr. Mulligan.

Here is a video about how a researcher's work flow can be improved by using Special Collections. The speaker is one of my clients, Dr. Wright from School of Humanities of Rice University.
